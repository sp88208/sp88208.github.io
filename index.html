	<h3 style="font-family:Impact; color:purple"> Story about FEAR </h3>
	<p style=color:black> <strong> <mark> Nyctophobia;  </mark> </strong>  It's defined as the irrational or extreme fear of the night or darkness. This fear turned into an amusing memory last year when my entire family and I went to the Helen Water Park in Helen, GA. Mind you, I had zero interest in going on most of the rides because dark, scary tunnels were the last thing on my wish list. Despite my protests, my mom sent me off to stand in line with my younger cousins for the scariest water slide I had ever seen. Once we all got to the top, I told my cousins, <mark> "Good luck with that," </mark> and I turned around to start making my way down the stairs. I was stopped by the ride manager, a girl probably a year older than me, and she asked if I was going to go on the slide. I tried to tell her no, but she cornered me by saying, <mark> "If these little kids can do it, then what are you so afraid of?" </mark> With my pride on the line, I decided then to sit down to see if it was really as nerve-racking as it seemed. I asked her to give me couple seconds to compose myself, but apparently I was dealing with a sociopath because she pushed me down the slide and into the dark abyss. I was so petrified that I began shrieking unintelligibly. I screamed so loud that by the time I reached the end of the slide, the security guards were waiting to see what had happened. <div> Ever since, my family always finds a way to tell everyone about the time Savan screamed so loud that the entire park was almost locked down. </div> </p>

	<h3 style="font-family:Fantasy; color:purple"> Story about COACHING </h3>
	<p style=color:black> I was given the opportunity to coach my younger brother's recreational basketball team <b> <mark>(Ace of &spades;)</mark> </b> for a game since the coach was sick. I was very unsure of myself, and the players could feel my uncertainty. As the game began, it was apparent that we were overmatched physically, and we were down by 13 points early. The kids began arguing on the bench and blaming others for our deficit. To diffuse the toxic situation, I told them that we must remain unified as a team and that I knew we were going to win this game. Hearing that from their coach gave them the confidence to play harder. It occurred to me that what we lacked in size we can make up for in stamina and speed. Sure enough, we gradually decreased the score gap. With 19 seconds remaining, we were down by only two points. As I drew up a simple 2-point layup to tie the game, the players argued they wanted me to make a play to the win. Although I wanted to play it safe, I realized I needed to continue keeping confidence in this team and myself. I ran an all-or-nothing play with our best shooter, and he made a game winning 3-point shot. As I stood there in disbelief, I remembered a quote that I read from <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> who stated, <b> <mark> Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage, and confidence in the doing.Äù </mark></b> <div> Now, whenever I feel uncertain, I revisit this moment to gain the confidence to put my best foot forward and inspire the same confidence in others around me. </div>

		<h3 style="font-family:cursive; color:purple"> Story about <del> Funny  </del> <ins>  Crazy </ins> PICTURES </h3>
		<p style="font-family:monospace; color:black"> Last spring break, I had the opportunity to go on a vacation with my friends from mandir (temple). As my friends and I were roaming around the different beaches at Myrtle Beach, a group of girls asked us if we can take some pictures for them. Honestly, we would've preferred playing football instead, but we agreed since they asked nicely and offered to take our pictures afterwards. We didn't really care about the pictures because we just wanted to live in the moment, but one of my friends said, "we might as well get some pictures taken since we took out the time to take theirs." Crazy person I am, I suggested, <mark> "why don't we take the exact same pictures we took for the girls?" </mark> Surprisingly, everyone agreed at the first hearing so we ended up taking some of the most childish and feminine pictures of our lives. As my friends have not given me permission to make all of the pictures available online, I have posted one of the pictures below.
